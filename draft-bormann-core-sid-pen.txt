            YANG-CBOR: Allocating SID ranges for PEN holders
                 draft-bormann-core-yang-sid-pen-latest

Abstract

   YANG-CBOR, RFC XXXX (draft-ietf-core-yang-cbor) defines YANG Schema
   Item iDentifiers (YANG SID), globally unique 63-bit unsigned integers
   used to identify YANG items.  RFC YYYY (draft-ietf-core-sid) defines
   ways to allocate these SIDs on the basis of IANA registries.

   The present specification uses these SID allocation mechanisms to
   allocate 100 000 SIDs for each holder of the first 1 000 000 holders
   of IANA-registered Private Enterprise Numbers (PENs).

1.  Introduction

   YANG-CBOR, RFC XXXX (draft-ietf-core-yang-cbor) defines YANG Schema
   Item iDentifiers (YANG SID), globally unique 63-bit unsigned integers
   used to identify YANG items.  RFC YYYY (draft-ietf-core-sid) defines
   ways to allocate these SIDs on the basis of IANA registries.

   The present specification uses these SID allocation mechanisms to
   allocate 100 000 SIDs for each holder of the first 1 000 000 holders
   of IANA-registered Private Enterprise Numbers (PENs).

   We allocate 100 000 mega-ranges, for the SID numbers 300 000 000 000
   to 399 999 999 999.

   The holder of a PEN ppp ppp then can use the SID numbers 3pp ppp p00
   000 to 3pp ppp p99 999 for allocation in a scheme defined by the
   holder.

2.  Example

   The Department for Mathematics and Computer Science of Universität
   Bremen holds PEN 30810.

   This confers control over the SID range 303 081 000 000 up to 303 081
   099 999 to this department.

3.  IANA Considerations

   This document allocates 100 000 SID mega-ranges as per Section 7.4 of
   [I-D.ietf-core-sid].

   The contact for the allocation is: IETF CORE Working Group
   (core@ietf.org) or IETF Applications and Real-Time Area
   (art@ietf.org)

   The allocation policy inside the mega-range is "private".  The URL is
   that of the present specification.

   The management of the SID blocks of 100 000 SIDs each, 10 such blocks
   for each mega-range 3nn nnn 000 000, is delegated to the PEN holder
   for nnn nnx, where x is the sequence number of the SID block in the
   mega-range.

   The technical capacity to ensure the sustained operation of the
   registry for a period of at least 10 years (as required for
   registries of class "private") is derived from the capacity of IANA
   to maintain the PEN number registry.
